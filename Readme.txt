In professional educational institutes,there is often a need of taking feedback from  different stakeholders viz students, parents, employers etc. Moreover, when a workshop   or seminar is conducted for students/faculty, feedback from the participants is collected to evaluate the quality of the contents delivered.
Many times feedback is collected by sharing a Google form with the participants which is  not a good option. The feedback received should be accessible only to the concerned authorities in the institute and not the hosting agencies. This module is being developed to conduct the following types of feedback under one umbrella:
1. On Academics( i.e.feedback on teaching-learning process given by students)
2. On different facilities like
    Library
    Sports
    Hostel and mess
3.About the workshops and seminars conducted.
